In this series I'm doing explorations with Web3 technologies. To get familiar with the toolchain I want to start with a simple application that allows a group of people to vote on some proposals. I'll start from the sample smart contract available on the Remix IDE (Ballot).

### Setting up a local Ethereum network

So there's this project called Ganache which creates an ethereum network locally with test accounts to test projects.


- Download Ganache  and install it.
- Create a new workspace 
- Setup MetaMask to connect to the local network.

I'm not sure about which Ethereum network to clone so I just chose Muirglacier.

## Creating the node project.

After setting up the local ethereum network is time to create the project where all the scripts and smart contracts will be located.
