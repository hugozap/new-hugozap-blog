It's not secret that finishing a side project is hard.

I've struggled with some side projects and had success with others. In this post I'll try to ellaborate on what worked based on my experience.

It is possible to work on and finish side projects even with a busy schedule, the key is to optimize for interruptability. You will be interrupted so instead of counting on having hours of deep work available, it's better to be realistic and make some adjustments so the available time can be more efficient. 

## A failed side project story

Maybe you are familiar with a similar situation

At the beggining:

- Lot's of motivation.
- Put everything else aside.
- Work long hours because it's really fun.
- It's easy to choose working on the project instead of doing other stuff (much more exciting).
- Burning desire to work with a new technology

After some time:

- Time to work on less exciting parts.
- Motivation decreases.
- Harder to justify working on the project.
- Other stuff seems more interesting now.
- Forgot how to set things up to continue working on the project, too much work required just to start and less mental energy available.
- Forget about it, or start a new side project...

## The challenges with side projects:

- Context switching and high cognitive load.
- **Losing interest / motivation**.
- Perfectionism / never ending projects.
- Mental exhaustion / burnout.
- Impostor syndrome.
- Lack of focus.
- Lack of time.
- Unexpected life events.

## Re framing the goal

I believe you can set yourself for failure from the start if the goal is not clear or not strong enough. 

Feeling overwhelemed can also contribute to abandoning the project, I'll talk about **small steps** and why it's key.

If your track record includes lot's of ambitious projects and none of them finished, then starting with something smaller seems like the logical approach. 

Pick a small battle, maybe just the key feature first, maybe support for just one platform. Cut off features for the first version, remember that there's a lot of forces against you completing your project so reducing load is important.

## The approach

Now that you have a clear idea of what you want to finish, there's some actions and adjustments to your process that will increase the chance of winning the battle (shipping).

- Preparing your environment (painless context switch)
- Work in **Small steps**
- Mental warm up before each session.
- Anticipate and expect interruptions.
- Changing your physical location.
- Save your mental context after each session.

## Small steps are key

I like the idea of having not having too many open boxes at the same time, where each box is a task/feature or something that you  started but haven't finished yet.

It's demoralizing to wait weeks or months for a win. Small steps give you small wins and that makes the journey sustainable, specially in terms of motivation.

## Warming up before each session to reduce cognitive exhaustion

Before starting actual work, write about what would be good to achieve in the session. I find this ritual valuable as it helps me detect the next small step. Writing the project goal (high level) is also a good way to switch context.

I'll talk about having a "context" log, where you write the current progress and what to do next. If you have this file, reading the previous session log is also part of the warm up and a great way to start your work session.

## Immediate context switching

With the limited amout of mental energy, is crucial to reduce the number of setup tasks required to do a working session on your project.

This is one of the most important things for me, and the way I approach it is:

- Creating a separated system User on my laptop
- Signing up for a new email address only for my project
- Having a "context" file where I log what's currently happening with my project, usually at the end of a work session.

These have been valuable tools for me, let me explain why:

### Having a separate system user

(Or even better, having a separate dev machine if possible)

By creating a separate user, you automatically have all the operative system tools (calendar/notes/reminders etc.) available ONLY for your project.

All the files on your desktop will have a relation to your project. This may not seem impresive but think about all the small distractions you find if you use the same user for your personal/work tasks:

- Time to find a file (filtering unrelated stuff will bring memories of other things)
- Reminders/calendar notifications not related to your project
- Dealing with other project setups can be stresful.

I think it was Seth Godin who recommended to have a separate laptop for a side project like writing a book. This is an alternative too.

You can add more extreme measures like redirecting distracting sites like news or reddit, I find that just by not logging into sites like twitter I'm protecting my concentration, I may have the reflex to go to twitter but having to login (and find my password on my password manager) is too much work and I don't do it.

### Having an separate email for your project

I'm a fan of email as a note taking tool, it's available everywhere. Having a separate email account and configuring your client email has a main advantage, you can send yourself notes/ideas/links from any device. This has been useful for me when I'm doing something else and have an idea, or find a resource that can be used to do something I want to incorporate into the project.

### The context file, (brain dump).

A context file is just a text file where you add a short summary of the current project status and what's on your mind at the time. 

This has been valuable to me, because the act of writing it down helps me have a clear idea of things I could do next and next time I have time to work on my project I'll have an starting point and it reduces the cognitive load which maximizes the session efficiency.

## Location

Going to a library or caf√© (when possible) or event to another room and have a dedicated space for your current side project will make a difference.

Not sure about why, but using the same desk for different work and side projects is not ideal for me. If you can I recommend having a different place that helps you switch context quickly.


## Abandoned projects may not be a failure after all.

Some abandoned projects end up being inspiration to create something else years later. Maybe you learnt something new, explored an idea or found a problem not possible to solve with your current knowledge and resources.

It's good to have an open mind and be ok with finding dead-ends, they are powerful teachers.

However shipping projects is awesome and by reducing scope and anticipating interruptions you will be able to complete your project and release it to the world.
