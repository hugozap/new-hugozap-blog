A few years ago I stopped using note taking applications and switched to email for my information capturing needs and it works.

I started to get used to the workflow of sending emails myself with notes and links. Searching for a note was easy and didn't miss any advanced feature of note apps. I used my personal email account and have automatic filters to add any email coming from myself the tag "notebook".

Some time later, convinced I liked this approach I created a separate email account just for the notes,quotes, links etc.


Some of the reasos I like this approach

## Simplicity

Email is simple, the user interface is well known and it just works. If I find something useful on the internet highlighting and sending it to my email will always work, it's fast and reliable.

I like to review my notes from time to time and the cognitive load feels less than using other UI's.

## Available everywhere

Email is everywhere and will always be. Clients have offline capabilities by default and the interface is standard, everyone can use it from every device. 

## Send notes from my kindle device

Even from my slow kindle device I can send notes with book quotes I want to keep. I made a mistake of using the native kindle notes feature but later discovered kindle highlights and note manager and export options are very limited. Now I just send everything to my notebook email account.

It's just simpler and available everywhere. Every platform has email client applications and the interface just works. 

## Search

Search is powerful in email platforms and clients, I care more about powerful search than having notes organized in hierarchies so it fits well with my process. 

## Filters

Email platforms have powerful ways to automatically filter messages so you can add tags based on keywords.

## Append Only

You can't modify messages and that's ok, If I need to add something else I'll send a new note or a reploy to the original thread. I just want to collect and rarely feel the need to edit a thought I had or a quote I wanted to save.


## Some tips

* Have a separate email account
* Use the native email client of your platform.
* Having a convention for the title (mail subject) helps but not really required.

### Have a separate email account

I started using my personal email and having a filter to automatically
tag messages sent from myself as "notebook" but I realized it's better
to have a  separate email acount just for my information capturing needs.

### Use the native client of your platform

If you setup your windows or mac email client now you have offline access to your notes and that's great, you can keep 


## When does it make sense to keep using specific note apps?

I've notice that some users are ver organized and have notebooks that are just beautiful. I'm not one of those persons, I tend to collect information from everywhere and just want to send it somewhere so I can find them easily in the future, that's why search is more important for me, but I definetely see traditional note taking apps being useful to people that are organized or using it to create structured content.
