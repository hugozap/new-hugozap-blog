# Question Driven Learning

- Always start with the question
- As you learn, ask yourself more questions
- Don't take notes, try to answer questions.


Whats the problem with Taking  Notes?

What does a note tell you? How short/long should the note be?
There are some tips given by note experts about notes

- Notes should be atomic
- Differentiate literature notes and permanent notes

There's good reasons for both of those, however they don't solve a few common problems with note taking.

- Notes are rarely reviewed
- Easy to fall in the trap of trying to curate the perfect knowledge base and not doing anything about it (A common trap in the note taking community)

## The problem of notes as plain information containers.

The main problem for me about generic notes, short or long is that they don't evoke any emotion and tend to become very plain. One person note can be very detailed, while other one may focus on the high level points about an idea. Depending on what you are going to do with your note this can be good or bad.

## What if *every* note answers a specific question?

So the idea is to start with a question and the note is your approximate answer.
It may be tempting to include additional details but instead of polluting the current note, try to formulate another question where the answer is the new group of information.

A benefit of this approach is that you take the control back and the notes you take make sense because they answer a specific question that is close to your mental process, existing experience. 


## Taking notes while you read (good or bad?)

Some people say that you should always have pen a paper when reading. In theory this sounds like a good idea. Personally I struggle with this for one reason, I tend to lose the "flow" and reading becomes very interrupted. I assume I'm not the only one who values the rythm of uninterrupted reading sessions.

Trying to capture ideas in my own words like the experts advice is not optimal for me, I feel that I'm not really engaging with the content as I'd like. Maybe it works for some people.

Those kind of notes I rarely review.

## What questions can you ask about a topic you've just started to learn?

That's a tricky one, if you don't know the domain, what useful questions do you have? 
I think there's some value in doing some exploratory reading that allows you to have the feeling of flow and sense of completion and then you can stop and focus on asking questions about what you have read.
