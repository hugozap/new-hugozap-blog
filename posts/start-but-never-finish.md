Someone posted on Reddit: "[NeedAdvice]  I never finish anything I start and no matter how many times I try, I always fail"

I'll leave my answer here in case someone else finds it useful:

First, it's ok to NOT finish stuff. Trying new things is exciting (dopamine release) BUT looks like you are looking for something more meaningful. I can provide some advice as I have been through this in the past and have learned about the creative process.

* The feeling of finishing something and releasing it is completely different, it's not about novelty but about persevering.

* It's not (always) about having fun: Finding difficulties is not "fun" but you have to stay there for a while to make progress. A lot of people quit when they feel uncomfortable (because nobody likes to feel stupid) but that's a trap! If you ignore that feeling and keep doing it, you will make progress. It happens gradually and you probably won't be impressed (but someone looking from the outside will)

* Do not quit when you fail! When going through the creative process, building something o learning or whatever, the more failing the better. Change the way you look at failure, every failure brings a small bit of mastery. People who are great at their thing have a long trail of "failures" but that's what made them great.

* When you look at awesome stuff that other people create you are looking only at the final result but not at the process, and the process was a mix of painful and rewarding moments, discarded drafts, probably tears but also some joy.

* Get comfortable releasing unfinished stuff. Or what some people refer to as "create in public". This will help to combat your fear of publishing something that's not perfect and unblock your creative process.

* Small progress everyday: Some days you will not "feel it" but there's always something you can do to advance even a little. Keep that in mind and you will be impressed with how much progress you make in a few weeks/months.

* Share your work with other creatives.

* Do not try to impress your friends/family: They probably won't (initially) appreciate your work and there's a risk of feeling demotivated by some of their comments. Even telling people your final goals is risky as you feel the dopamine rush without actually doing anything. Better to hold it and just commit to the practice.

* Look for authors/creatives that know about the creative process. I like Seth Godin, but read about people creative process, their routines, their challenges and you will see that it's very different to how mainstream media (and social media) portrays it.

I think your initial attempts at different stuff are valuable and may give you some hints about what worked and what didn't. You can re-frame your experience, not label yourself as a quitter (labels are self-fulfilling) and just work on your stuff.
