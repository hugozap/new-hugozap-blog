Hi, I'm Hugo.

I'm a Software Engineer currently living in Bogot√°. I've worked in different industries and roles with technologies like Node.js, React, AWS, Rust and others. I'm currently interested in building tools for helping people to be more productive and creative.  I'm optimist about the future and I believe technology can help us to solve some of the problems we face.

I'm currently learning about WebAssembly, Rust and other technologies that I believe will transform the way we create software.
