Hi, I'm Hugo.

I'm the creator of [Diagram Codes](https://diagram.codes)
and other tools.

I like to build stuff, mostly digital.

I started [Volare Labs](https://volarelabs.co) with the goal
of crystallizing ideas, building cool products and have fun.

Some of the things I'm currently interested in:

- Educational technology.
- Building tools that help people use technology efficiently.
- Intersection of code,art,math and philosopy.
- Human/machine collaboration for design (procedural stuff, ML, etc).
- Livable cities.
